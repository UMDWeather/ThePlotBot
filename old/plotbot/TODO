Fix GFS/HRRR plotbots to work recursively?
	The basic idea is there but the current
	implementation uses up too much cpu
	
	I would create one watchdog that delegates what script runs
	based off of what file is created

	Or can I pipe the LDM data directly to a python script???
		This would require rewriting the driver scripts for plots but
		is probably more efficient. Ask T.Sluka/D.T.Kleist about which
		would be better (this would not archive data, but may be tricky
		to accomplish what we want for model output, probably the way to
		go for sat/rad though...
